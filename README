This is the Readme for the GWT Z-Machine interpreter.

The source is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL
PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 -- see the LICENSE file.

The interpreter is based on the ZAX interpreter of
Matt Kimmel, which can be downloaded from
https://github.com/mattkimmel/zax/.

To compile the source, the gwt-log library and the
gwt-gears libraries have to be downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-log/ and
http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/wiki/Downloads?tm=2
respectively.

Other than that, only the GWT is required --
this source version works with GWT Version 2.3.

This was my first GWT project and one of my
first java projects, so not everything is
done in an elegant way. For example the way
special character support was added to ZAX is
very dirty.
