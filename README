This is the Readme for the GWT Z-Machine interpreter.

The source is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3 -- see the LICENSE file.

The interpreter is based on the ZAX interpreter of Matt Kimmel, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/mattkimmel/zax/.

To compile the source, the gwt-log library and the gwt-gears libraries have to be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/gwt-log/ and http://code.google.com/p/gwt-google-apis/wiki/Downloads?tm=2 respectively.

Other than that, only the GWT is required -- this source version works with GWT Version 2.3.

This was my first GWT project and one of my first java projects, so not everything is done in an elegant way.
For example the way special character support was added to ZAX is very dirty.
